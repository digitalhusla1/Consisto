# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Your application is now ready for Netlify deployment! Here's what has been configured:

### 📁 File Structure
```
├── netlify.toml              # Netlify configuration
├── package.json              # Dependencies
├── .env.example             # Environment variables template
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/
│       ├── generate.js      # Image generation API
│       └── health.js        # Health check API
├── index.html              # Main application
├── script.js               # Updated with API detection
└── style.css               # Styling
```

### 🔧 Configuration Changes Made

1. **API Functions**: Created Netlify Functions in `netlify/functions/`
2. **Dynamic API Detection**: Updated `script.js` to automatically detect environment
3. **Environment Variables**: Configured for Netlify deployment
4. **CORS Headers**: Properly configured for production
5. **Content Filtering**: Enhanced with 6 keyword checks and length validation

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Ready for Netlify deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/consistent-images.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Netlify CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy from your project directory
netlify deploy

# For production deployment
netlify deploy --prod
```

#### Option B: Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `.`
   - **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`

### 3. Set Environment Variables

In your Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to **Site Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add your environment variable:
   - **Key**: `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: `your_actual_replicate_token`

### 4. Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `https://yoursite.netlify.app/` - Main application
- `https://yoursite.netlify.app/api/health` - Health check
- Upload an image and generate - Full functionality test

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ CORS properly configured

- Proper API routing for Netlify Functions
- Enhanced security and content filtering
- Professional error handling

## 🛠️ Local Development

To continue local development:
```bash
npm start  # Starts local server on localhost:3002
```

The application automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate API endpoints.

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check Netlify Function logs in your dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test the health endpoint first: `/api/health`
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

Your application is ready to go live! 🎉
